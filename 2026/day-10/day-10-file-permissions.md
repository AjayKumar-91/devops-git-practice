What I Learned

Linux permissions are divided into owner, group, and others, each with read, write, and execute rights.

The chmod command can modify permissions using symbols (+x, -w) or numeric values (640, 755).

Without proper permissions, Linux blocks actions like writing to files or executing scripts with “Permission denied” errors.
