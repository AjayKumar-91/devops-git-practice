This process management cheat sheet covers essential Linux commands to monitor, control, and prioritize running programs. Key commands include ps for snapshots, top/htop for real-time monitoring, kill for termination, and nice for priority management, allowing users to efficiently manage system resources. 

Process Monitoring & Listing

ps: Displays a snapshot of current active processes.
ps aux: Shows all running processes by all users.
top: Provides a dynamic, real-time view of running processes and resource usage.
htop: An interactive, more user-friendly version of top.
pgrep [name]`: Searches for processes by name and lists their PID. 

Process Termination (Kill)

kill [PID]`: Sends a termination signal to a process.
kill -9 [PID]: Forcefully terminates a process (SIGKILL).
pkill [name]`: Terminates processes based on their name.
killall [name]`: Kills all processes with the specified name. 

Process Priority & Management

nice -n [value] [command]`: Starts a process with a specific priority (niceness).
renice -n [value] -p [PID]`: Changes the priority of an already running process.
jobs: Lists active jobs running in the background.
bg: Moves a suspended job to the background.
fg: Brings a background job to the foreground. 

System Resource Monitoring

free -m: Displays memory usage in MB.
vmstat: Reports virtual memory statistics.
