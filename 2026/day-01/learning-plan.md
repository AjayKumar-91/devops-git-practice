1. What is DevOps? (The Process)
DevOps is a cultural approach and a set of practices that bridges the gap between software developers (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).

Goal: To deliver software faster, more frequently, and with fewer errors.

Key Concept: Automation. It removes manual steps in testing, building, and deploying code. 

3. What is Cloud Engineering?
Cloud Engineering focuses on designing, building, and managing the infrastructure on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

Goal: To ensure the environment is secure, scalable, and cost-effective.

Key Concept: Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Using code to set up servers instead of manually clicking buttons. 

3. Key Differences
Feature 	             DevOps Engineer	                               Cloud Engineer
Focus	                 Software Delivery Process (Pipeline)	           Infrastructure & Environment
Main Goal	             Speed, Reliability, Automation	                 Security, Scalability, Cost
Tools	                 Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes  	 AWS, Azure, GCP, Terraform
Analogy	               The "Assembly Line" Operator	                   The "Factory Floor" Builder

4. How They Work Together (The Real-World Scenario)
In modern companies, these roles overlap heavily (often called "Cloud DevOps"). 
The Scenario: A company needs to launch a new app update.
Cloud Engineer's Role: Uses Terraform to create a secure, scalable virtual server environment on AWS (e.g., EC2 instances).
DevOps Engineer's Role: Uses Jenkins to build a pipeline that automatically pulls the new code, tests it, and deploys it onto the servers the Cloud Engineer created. 
Conclusion: The Cloud Engineer builds the house, and the DevOps Engineer builds the automated, fast-moving assembly line inside that house.

Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?
Learning DevOps and Cloud is widely considered a top career move in 2026 because it combines high demand, high salaries, and future-proof skills. In short, it is the modern way to build, deploy, and manage software faster and more reliably.
